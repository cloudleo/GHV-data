    "description": "Climate is just one factor that influences the spread of the Zika virus, as well as other diseases transmitted by mosquitos, like dengue and malaria. Other things that can lead to Zika, dengue and malaria spreading in new areas include XYZ. Many of these other influences are complex, and even if we understand them are hard to measure or predict. But with climate, we can measure and predict it in many places, so we can better understand how it may influence the spread of a disease in the past or the future. Scientists at IRI are studying how climate may have influenced the spread of Zika in the past in order to understand how it may continue to spread in the future. The main way that climate affects Zika is by influencing the optimal temperature and rainfall conditions for the mosquitos that transmit the virus. Because the mosquitos breed in still water, when heavy rains fall there can be more breeding habitats for the mosquitos, which can breed in a container as small as a bottle cap. On the other hand, in some areas, when it’s very rainy people may be more likely to stay inside where they are less likely to be bitten by a mosquito. Dry weather can also influence the availability of places to breed — when there is drought, people tend to store water in buckets and other containers. This can increase the number of mosquitos, as well as the number of mosquitos near humans. Temperature also has an effect — in warmer temperatures, both the mosquito and the virus itself develop faster (is there an upper limit to temp?). Using statistics (anything else, fundamentally?), scientists are studying these patterns over large areas. So far, they’ve discovered that rainfall is likely to influence Zika spread on seasonal and year-to- year scales, while warming temperatures are likely to influence it on a long-term, climate change scale."
